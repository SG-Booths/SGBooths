# SG Booths
## Description
With so many art & crafts/maker events happening in Singapore each month, it can be difficult to keep track of new events and the creators who will be boothing there.
Enter SG Booths – an app that organises upcoming events and booths, helping you find the next event to go to and even new creators to follow!

Checking creators’ social media pages for upcoming events is fine, but it can be tedious and often doesn’t provide the opportunity to discover new favourites. On the other hand, SG Booths does the work for you, collating all the info you need into one app. Whether you’re a visitor trying to plan which event to go to next, or a creator who wants to find other like-minded individuals to booth together with, SG Booths is the app for you. Download SG Booths and discover upcoming maker events as well as new favourite creators.

SG Booths offers features such as:
- Separate accounts for creators and visitors
- Search and filtering for events and creators
- A Saved list to view your saved events and creators at one glance
- Customisation to your profile so you can add shop/product images and a link to your Instagram account (creators only)
- and more...

## Technologies
